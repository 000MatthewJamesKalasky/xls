# XLS Tutorials

The XLS team has written several tutorials to help explain language features and
design techniques. Here they are, grouped by topic:

## DSLX

*   [Hello, XLS!](hello_xls.md) : A brief introduction to writing and evaluating
    your first design in DSLX.
*   [Float-to-int conversion](float_to_int.md) : A guide to writing "real" logic
    in DSLX, demonstrated by creating an IEEE-754 binary32, i.e., C `float` to
    `int32_t` converter.
*   [Intro to parametrics](intro_to_parametrics.md) : A demonstration on how
    functions and types can be parameterized to allow a single implementation to
    apply to many different data layouts.
